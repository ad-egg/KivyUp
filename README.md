# KivyUp

A MarkDown text parser with simple, more intuitive syntax providing a much cleaner experience with writing markdown files, such as README's like this one! The GUI is inviting and clean supplying a much more pleasing experience for the inexperienced software engineer, especially during the undertaking of documentation. Hopefully this documentation equally illuminates and demarcates the capabilities of KivyUp.
